# Shoraldele

One weird-as-hell visual editor

## Building

Basically, to build,

`source setup.sh && ./build.sh`

To edit source

`source setup.sh`

## Using

Protip: Don't

But if you really want to, specify what file to edit as the arugument when running shoraldele. Once running, `i` goes into insert mode, esc goes back to command mode, `o` to write out.
